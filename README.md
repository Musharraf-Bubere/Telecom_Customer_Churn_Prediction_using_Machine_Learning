# 📊 Telecom Customer Churn Prediction using Machine Learning

## 🔍 Project Overview
Customer churn is a critical problem in the telecom industry, where retaining existing customers is more cost-effective than acquiring new ones.  
This project focuses on **predicting customer churn** using machine learning techniques based on customer behavior and service usage data.

The goal is to help telecom companies **identify customers likely to churn** and take proactive retention actions.

## 📈 Results & Insights
- Customers with **month-to-month contracts** show higher churn rates
- **Higher monthly charges** are strongly associated with churn
- Long-term contracts significantly reduce churn probability
- Tree-based models performed better in capturing non-linear patterns

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Hyperparameter tuning for better performance
- Try advanced models like **XGBoost / LightGBM**
- Handle class imbalance using **SMOTE**
- Deploy model using **Flask or FastAPI**
